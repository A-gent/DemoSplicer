# DemoSplicer
A program for combining multiple Source demos into one for segmented runs.

# OMG CAN SOMEONE CHEAT WITH THIS?????
1. demos aren't sufficient proof for runs anyway, if they were you could also segment your run by map
2. demos spliced using this program can be detected

# TODO:
Portal 2 support
Fix the audio(allow sound to play through demo transitions while removing duplicate sounds from the following demo)
Fix issue with header files occasionally being read incorrectly
Write correct information into the header file instead of just copying it from the first demo
Fix the weird crouching bug after demo transitions while holding crouch
Fix some particle related errors after demo transitions
some other shit probably
