# DemoSplicer
A program for combining multiple Source demos into one for segmented runs.

# OMG CAN SOMEONE CHEAT WITH THIS?????
1. Demos aren't sufficient proof for runs anyway, if they were you could also segment your run by map.
2. Demos spliced using this program can be detected.

# TODO
Portal 2 support

Fix the audio(allow sound to play through demo transitions while removing duplicate sounds from the following demo)

Fix issue with headers occasionally being read incorrectly

Write correct information into the header file instead of just copying it from the first demo

Fix the weird crouching bug after demo transitions while holding crouch

Fix some particle related errors after demo transitions

some other shit probably
